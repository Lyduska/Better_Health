Chronic diseases in America, 4 highest categories, 3 risk factors and what can we as individuals do to improve chronic disease in USA.
Cost of chronic disease overall on our healthcare system, looking at data NHE from several decades 1960 - 2022.
How much chronic disease have increased in population & how they affect every state.
My focus is data from CDC, FDA, and data from National Center of Educational Statistics.

### Datasets

1)	CDC websites: chronic disease (looking at specific categories, creating data frames, tables, visualization and at the end using interactive maps) https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.htmlhttps://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html

2)	National Health Expenditures in Excel below https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet

4)	I downloaded CSV for 2022 (looking at learning disabilities data by state) https://data.ed.gov/dataset/idea-section-618-state-part-b-child-count-and-educational-environments/resources?resource=91dfcdc0-7e9b-4945-8319-684f9ffd2a24


### Questions
